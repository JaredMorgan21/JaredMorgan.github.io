                        My master's thesis. This work explores solving legged robot trajectories where the selection of end effector dynamics are optimizable.
                        This problem lends itself well to mixed-integer optimization, an optimization framework that combines linear inputs and states such as forces and positions with integer or binary decisions such as contact or contact dynamics.
                        This work presents a novel contribution to the world of legged robotics and increases their decision-making capacity.

                        This work represents the culmination of my first modern controls course.
                        Here we linearized the dynamics of the highly nonlinear quadrotor and implemented a LQR solution with the addition of integral action.
                        This allowed us to solve the problem of intercepting a UAV within a controlled airspace and bringing it back to home base while increasing efforts as the UAV resisted.
                        The problem? Not all small-angle approximations are equally valid and the instability of linearizing cosine caused an imbalance in accepted forces in one direction.
                        This project kicked off my love of modern controls and desire to research increasingly nonlinear problems.

                        8 months before the AI boom created by the release of ChatGPT, I employed Tensorflow to train a RNN-based NLG model to generate text based on a database of affirmations submitted to a popular meme page on campus.
                        Combined with a pipeline for sourcing and editing images, I and the team I worked with created a program that automatically generated memes specific to our campus.
                        I'm not saying OpenAI was inspired by this project, but I am saying GPT-4 was released afterwards.
